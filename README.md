## National Science Week (updated 25 September 2020)

During National Science Week here in Australia the E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$ team and The Breaking Good Project hosted an expert panel discussion on the world's most important medicines - the essential medicines. The panel discussed some of the barriers to accessing the essential medicines and how we might be able to break down these barrier. The event was recorded and is now up on our YouTube channel.
