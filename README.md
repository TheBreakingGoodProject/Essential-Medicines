## Welcome to E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$ - our new Breaking Good project! 

We want to find out more about the most important medicines for human health and we need your help! Join us to create a public database that will help to improve our understanding of the accessibility of essential medicines for people around the world.

Here on GitHub, you can talk to other contributors and ask us any questions that you may have. Head to the discussion tab to join a conversation or start a new one. Check out the issues tab to read blogs written by the team about what we are up to.

## Ready to Contribute?
