We want to find out more about the most important medicines for human health and we need your help! Join us to create a public database that will help to improve our understanding of the accessibility of essential medicines for people around the world.

## Good news :) Stage I of E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$ is now open for contributions!

For the first round of the project, we’re focusing on medicines in the USA (don’t worry, in the next round, we will go global). We want to create a database of essential medicines that are approved for use in the USA.

It's easy to start contributing to E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$. All you have to do is click here [insert link] and follow the instructions in the form (watch out for some accompanying videos coming soon). 

We’re here to help every step of the way and have prepared detailed explanations to guide you through the process and assist you with finding the information and filling in the form. You can access the guide here [insert link].
