## Welcome to E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$ - our new Breaking Good project! 

We want to find out more about the most important medicines for human health and we need your help! Join us to create a public database that will help to improve our understanding of the accessibility of essential medicines for people around the world.

Here on GitHub, you can talk to other contributors and ask us any questions that you may have. Head to the issues tab to join a converstation or start a new one.

## Important project update  27-05-2020
Thanks to your commitment and hard work, we are ahead of schedule and have finalised phase I of data collection! 
We are working hard to [develop the next stages of the project](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/Essential-Medicines/issues/5) and are also focusing on opening the full database to the public domain. 
We will update here shortly when Phase II is open for data collection.


## Good news :) Stage I of E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$ is now open for contributions!

For the first round of the project, we’re focusing on medicines in the USA (don’t worry, in the next round, we will go global). We want to create a database of essential medicines that are approved for use in the USA.

It's easy to start contributing to E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$. All you have to do is click here [insert link] and follow the instructions in the form (watch out for some accompanying videos coming soon).
