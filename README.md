## Welcome to E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$ - our new Breaking Good project! 

We want to find out more about the most important medicines for human health and we need your help! Join us to create a public database that will help to improve our understanding of the accessibility of essential medicines for people around the world.

Here on GitHub, you can talk to other contributors and ask us any questions that you may have. Head to the issues tab to join a conversation or start a new one.

## Stage I is now complete (updated 26 June 2020)

Thanks to your commitment and hard work, we have now finalised the first stage of data collection on the anti-infection essential medicines! :tada::confetti_ball:

We are now working on the development of database where we will store all this information. If you would like to contribute you can join [here](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/Essential-Medicines/issues/4).

In the interim, we have published all the data we collected in Stage I openly as an excel file on figshare. You can access it [here](https://figshare.com/s/4730b089228a2a21e4ae).


## Good news :) Stage II of E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$ is now open for contributions! (updated 26 June 2020)

With Stage I of E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$ now complete, we are going to build upon this information in Stage II through a discovery investigation into the life of essential medicines in the USA. We invite you to join us on a mission in the pursuit of information. 

In Stage II, we want to investigate and identify any other important life events from birth (first approval) to current day, including if the medicine is deceased (product is discontinued). This information will help us to understand why and how the accessibility to some of the essential medicines has changed over time.

You can joing today and start contributing to E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$. All you have to do is [click here](https://redcap.sydney.edu.au/surveys/index.php?s=4WDFKF8PJM) and follow the instructions in the form.
